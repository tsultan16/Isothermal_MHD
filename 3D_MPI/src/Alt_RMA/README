Alternate version of the main code:

This version uses passive target RMA. It seems to be slower 
than active target RMA. Need to figure out why and how to speed it up.
Also, there's a barrier in the 'initiate_halo_exchange()' subroutine.
Not including this barrier causes program to hang on multi-node system.
That's not supposed to happen, but oh well.. The barrier is just a 
band-aid fix for now.
